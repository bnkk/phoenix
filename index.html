                        The Phoenix Project was written in an attempt to try and create a very simple and easy to understand programming language that novices and experts can pick up with ease.
                        Phoenix is built to be 100% free and open source with no strings attached. We do not collect any of your data and we welcome suggestions and contributions to the project.
