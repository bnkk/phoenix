# Phoenix Project <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/issues/bnkk/phoenix"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/bnkk/phoenix/prerelease"/>

Phoenix Project's goal is to be a modern, general purpose programming language derived from Python. Phoenix will be able to run .enx files which are a plain-text script file similar to what you would find in a Python file (.py).

More information about the project will be available soon...

## Bug reports
For reporting bugs, open a new issue on this GitHub repository using the bug report issue template and describe your issue in depth. A team member/contributer will respond to you as soon as possible. For issues regarding security vulnerabilities, send me an email directly at banko.production.network@gmail.com

## Feature suggestions
Similarly to bug reports, in order to make a feature request you will need to create a new issue on this repository using the feature request template. As feature requested are a lower priority than our bug reports, it may take some time before a response is given.

## Issue tracker policies
- Proposing new features and guidance on bug reports must be done in their respective locations. Please do not disguise a feature suggestion as a bug report.
- Any issue created in the wrong category will be closed.
- Issues where we have identified to be outside of Phoenix scope, such as an upstream bug, will be closed.
- We will actively close any unrelated and non-actionable issues to keep the issue tracker clean and clutter free.
- We may get things wrong from time to time, please feel free to revisit old issues and reopen them if necessary.

We also ask to keep the tone positive and be kind to one another!
